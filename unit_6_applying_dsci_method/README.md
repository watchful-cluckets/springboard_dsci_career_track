# Unit 6 -- Applying the Data Science Method

In this unit, youâ€™ll get to see data science in action (and be part of that action)! The Data Science Method (DSM) is the process you'll rely on to solve any data science problem you come up against. You already learned about problem identification, which is the first step in this process. Now, you'll work through each of the DSM's steps and get your first taste of an end-to-end data science project.

The work contained here is for Data Science Guided Capstone related to Big Mountain Resort.
